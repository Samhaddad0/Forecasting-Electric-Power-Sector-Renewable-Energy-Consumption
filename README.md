Forecasting Electric Power Sector Renewable Energy Consumption

📁 Project Overview:

This project forecasts Total Renewable Energy Consumption in the U.S. Electric Power sector using monthly data from 1973–2024. 
The objective is to evaluate how well different time series models capture long-term growth, seasonality, and structural changes in renewable 
energy usage, with a focus on forecasts for 2025–2028.

The analysis compares Holt-Winters (Exponential Smoothing), ARIMA, and SARIMA models to identify the most accurate and reliable forecasting approach.

🎯 Problem Statement:

Renewable energy consumption has increased significantly over time due to policy decisions, technological advances, and environmental factors. Accurate forecasting is essential for:

  -Grid reliability and capacity planning

  -Resource allocation and optimization

  -Tracking progress toward decarbonization goals

🎯 Objectives:

  -Build a forecasting model with a target MAPE < 5%

  -Identify long-term trends and seasonal patterns in renewable energy consumption

  -Compare Holt-Winters, ARIMA, and SARIMA model performance

  -Generate forecasts for the 2025–2028 period and assess policy implications
